# Elevator-Similator
A simulation made via SystemVerilog uses an FPGA and a step motor.

It is a High Level State Machine with datapath and controller.
Gets input from user via buttons and moves the motor accordingly.
Number of turns for motor is calculated by the difference of the
current floor and target floor value.
